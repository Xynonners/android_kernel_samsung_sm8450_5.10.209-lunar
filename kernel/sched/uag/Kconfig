	  This governor makes decisions based on the utilization.  It sets
	  the CPU frequency to be proportional to the utilization/capacity
	  ratio coming from the scheduler or frameboost.  If the utilization
	  is frequency-invariant, the new frequency is also proportional to
	  the maximum available frequency.  If that is not the case, it is
	  proportional to the current frequency of the CPU.

	  If in doubt, say N.

config OPLUS_UAG_NONLINEAR_FREQ_CTL
	bool "Non-linear frequency control"
	depends on OPLUS_CPU_FREQ_GOV_UAG
	default n
	help
	  Choose this option to enable non-linear frequency control.
	  This will change per-opp capacity from linear scaled by
	  frequency to evaluated by benchmark. This makes capacity
	  more accurate and will let scheduler/schedutil use more
	  suitable frequency.

config OPLUS_UAG_USE_TL
	bool "Use target loads in uag cpufreq policy governor"
	depends on OPLUS_CPU_FREQ_GOV_UAG
	default n

	  Add target_loads sysfs attr in uag cpufreq policy governor.

config OPLUS_UAG_AMU_AWARE
	bool "Consider amu info for cpufreq decision"
	depends on OPLUS_CPU_FREQ_GOV_UAG

	  Consider AMU info such as cycles/stall ... to adjust cpufreq.

config OPLUS_UAG_MULTI_LV_TL
	bool "Add multi-level target loads to scale cpu frequency"
	depends on OPLUS_CPU_FREQ_GOV_UAG
	default n
	help
	  Add multi-level target loads to scale cpu frequency.

config OPLUS_UAG_TOUCH_BOOST
	bool "Enable touch-based CPU frequency boost"
	depends on OPLUS_CPU_FREQ_GOV_UAG
	default n
    help
      Enables dynamic CPU frequency boosting in response to user touch input events.
      When a touch event is detected (e.g., on a touchscreen, touchpad, or keypad),
      this feature temporarily increases the CPU's minimum frequency to improve
      responsiveness. The frequency boost is automatically reverted after a short
      duration.

config OPLUS_UAG_SOFT_LIMIT
	bool "Soft frequency limit in uag cpufreq policy governor"
	depends on OPLUS_CPU_FREQ_GOV_UAG
	default n
	help
	  Add soft frequency limit in uag cpufreq policy governor.
	  Frequency can breakthrough this limit in UA scene.

	depends on OPLUS_CPU_FREQ_GOV_UAG && OPLUS_FEATURE_FRAME_BOOST
